- 👋 Hi, I’m @jarask
- 👀 I’m interested in computational biology, advanced microscopy, and spatial transcriptomics.
- 👨‍💻 I mainly use Python and R, but I can also program in Java, C#, and look-alikes.
- 🌱 I’m currently doing my Master's thesis in Computational Biomedicine with focus on spatial transcriptomics (especially Multiplexed Error-Robust Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization/MERFISH).
- 📫 Feel free to contact me here on GitHub! 😎
